# JavaScript Programming Bootcamp

## TODO

- Properly align each directory with the proper subject

- Finish study guide html

- Create and finalize exercises for each of the topics

- Add SWBATs for each topic README

- Properly comment each topic's example code correctly

- Add lessons & exercises for day 12 onwards

## How To Use This Template

1. Create a copy of the template with:
```bash
cp -r nd-javascript-bootcamp NEW-LOCATION-HERE
cd NEW-LOCATION-HERE
rm -rf .git
git init
```

2. Remove the information for *How To Use This Template* from the copied repository's `README.md`.

3. Add identifying information for the cohort, generally in the format of `MMDDYY` to this readme. For example: `Repository for Javascript Bootcamp cohort starting 020226`.

4. In each directory delete the relevant code from the `.js` files with the exception of any `exercise.js` files. Refer to the template if you need example code for each of the days.

5. Add, commit, and push your repository to GitHub. Save the GitHub link to be shared with students.

6. The `index.html` in the `study-guide` directory has been formatted for use with `github.io` so you may also go to the Pages area of Settings on GitHub and deploy it, changing it as you see fit.

7. The final week is considered bonus material and includes enough material for each day. You may add or remove material as necessary.
