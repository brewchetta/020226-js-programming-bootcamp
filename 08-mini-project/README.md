# Lesson 08 - Mini Project #1

## Deliverables

1. Create a concept for a mini-project and build user stories for it (a user will be able to...)

2. The project must use Javascript / HTML.

3. The project must include at least 2 event listeners.

4. The project must include at least 1 array.

5. There is no minimum number of lines of code, build code that makes sense for your project.

6. Maintain your project using `git` and be sure to push to GitHub regularly.

## Hints

1. Choose a topic interesting to you that you won't mind looking at for a day or two.

2. Start small with a minimum viable product a.k.a. the core functionality first.

3. Break large problems into smaller ones, build functions to solve individual problems.

4. You build the HTML so make sure it's easy to target with your Javascript selectors.
