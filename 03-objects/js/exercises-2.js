// OBJECT METHOD EXERCISES

// 1. Create a new object `car` with these attributes: `make`, `model`, `gallonsInTank`, `maxGallons`, `currentMiles` (you may use the example below or make a new one...)

// 2. Give the `car` a method `describeMakeAndModel` which returns the `make` and `model` for the car. For example: "Ford Taurus"

// 3. Give the `car` a method `fillTank` which sets the `gallonsInTank` to the `maxGallons`

// 4. Give the `car` a method `goForADrive` which sets the `gallonsInTank` to 5 less than it was and also sets `currentMiles` to be 100 more than it was

// 5. Give the `car` a method `rewindMiles` which sets `currentMiles` to 0

// the gauge for a car's mileage is called an odometer for those curious
// rewinding the odometer is illegal btw
