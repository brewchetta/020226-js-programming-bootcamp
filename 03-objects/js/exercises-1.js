// OBJECT EXERCISES

// 1. Create an object for your favorite tv show (or just pick one... whatever) and create an object for it

// 2.  That object needs to have a title, a number of seasons, and a number of episodes

// 3. Additionally I'd like you to create a nested object with a review, and that review has a title, a reviewer (can be your name or someone else) and content

// 4. Can you console.log
// - the title
// - the number of episodes
// - a pretty printed version of the review that looks like this: 
// "{review title} by {reviewer name}: {review content}"
