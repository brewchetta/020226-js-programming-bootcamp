// ARRAY EXERCISES

// 1. Create a new array of sodas - make sure there are at least 2 sodas in the array.

// 2. Use a for loop to console.log each soda.toUpperCase.

// 3. Use a .forEach to iterate through the sodas and print out "{soda} is super fizzy"

// 4. Use any loop of your choice and if the soda has the word "cola" inside of it, console.log that soda name.
